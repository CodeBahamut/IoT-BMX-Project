This project is a part of the group project for the course "IoT and Embedded Systems".
It aims at recording weather data at the start of the BMX Course used by Team-NL to train their riders for the Olympic games.
In that sport the start is an important factor towards victory.
During training the conditions greatly influence their performance coming down the ramp.
The goal would be to homogenize their times in relation to the weather.
